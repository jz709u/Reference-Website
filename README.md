# Reference-Website
This repository will hold code for a web app that will be hosted at www.<to-be-determined>.com.
  
##### The Problem:
As a lifelong learner I find enjoyment in learning new things.  My job requires me to learn new software, tools, languages, methodologies, algorithms, design, and social skills.
I don't know how much the average person can recall but I can only recall things that I experience on a regular basis.  For example, when I go shopping I know roughly the price of an onion is because I regulary buy onions often at the same store but if I went to buy a piece of celery at the same store I wouldn't know how much that would cost because I rarely buy celery.  

This website will be record system of important things to keep in my memory.

### RoadMap
1. Django server
2. SQL DB
3. HTML5/CSS/JS Web App
4. React
5. Class Base Tagging
6. Relational Tagging
7. Memory Mapping
8. Machine Learning by tags to determine which content needs to reshown to me
